## 🌟 Overview & Core Philosophy

**SZWBT 2026** is a comprehensive, production-grade tournament management ecosystem built with a distinctive **16-bit retro arcade / anime sports aesthetics** paired with modern web engineering. Designed to run the South Zone Inter-University Women's Badminton Championship, the platform manages the entire lifecycle of high-stakes university badminton tournaments:

- **18 Specialized Command Portals & Dashboards**: Dedicated operational environments tailored for every stakeholder from Chief Umpires to Team Managers, Bus Drivers, and Super Admins.
- **BWF Official Match Scoring Engine**: 21-point rally scoring with sudden-death ceiling at 30, service judge fault tracking, yellow/red/black cards, medical timeouts, and cryptographically verifiable digital scoresheets.
- **4-Bed Contingent Hostel Allocation**: Precision room and bed management across *Shalmala Block* and *Vindhya Block*, keeping 5-member contingents together while monitoring room capacities.
- **Zero Transport Payment Policy**: Real-time university shuttle fleet tracking between Hubballi Junction / Hubballi Airport and the campus with strict zero-cost enforcement.
- **Real SMTP & Dynamic OTP Verification**: Live email-based one-time password security for contingent registration, pass validation, and account protection.
- **Tamper-Evident Audit Logging**: Every administrative action, score override, financial receipt, and credential reset is logged immutably.

## 🕹️ Aesthetic Design System: 16-Bit Retro Arcade

The interface merges the nostalgic energy of classic 90s Japanese arcade games (*Street Fighter II, Capcom Sports Club, Neo Geo*) with smooth modern web motion:
- **CRT Scanline Filter**: Optional toggleable CRT scanlines, flicker, and barrel distortion shaders.
- **Pixel HUD & Borders**: Custom 8-bit and 16-bit bevel borders, arcade status bars, pulsing health/readiness gauges, and gold coin point counters.
- **Interactive Three.js Intro**: Dynamic 3D shuttlecock physics canvas welcoming visitors at the tournament gates.
- **Sound & Motion**: GSAP and Framer Motion spring transitions with 8-bit victory confetti cannons.

## 🛡️ Security & Zero-Payment Policy Highlights

1. **Complimentary Campus Shuttle**: All transport between Hubballi Junction, Hubballi Airport, and the KLE Tech campus is **100% free**. No payment options or fees exist anywhere in the transport or support modules.
2. **Credential Sanitization**: Passwords, hashes, and session identifiers are strictly filtered and never returned over public or administrative API responses.
3. **Audit Trail**: Every critical action creates an immutable log containing actor ID, IP address, timestamp, action category, and state diffs.
